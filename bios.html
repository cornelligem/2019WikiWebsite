                        Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, Rahul Rambhatla. A truly mythological being in all sense of the word. His ability to solve the hardest ChemE problem sets only rivals his ability to resist the temptation of meat. Some might question why a chemical engineer leads a synthetic biology project team, Rahul is one of those people. He is not immune to the difficulties of this world however, on late nights you may find him swiping aimlessly on Tinder, but he carries a far bigger weight than most, the looming presence of arranged marriage. On most days you can find him in Weill or Duffield, and on truly (un)lucky days you may see him sporting one of his polos or t-shirts, with his dad bod on full display. Ride on Rahul, ride on.

                        Amith Punyala (2018)
                        <br>
                        <br>Pretty much any old Joe Schmoe can count cells under a microscope or click buttons on one of those new-fangled electronic plate readers.  But for what we in the trade know as “wetwork” … you need a professional.  A professional like Amith Punyala.
                        <br>
                        <br>After a long and distinguished career liquidating LB stock and spilling brain heart infusion, Amith retired to live a life in peace on his quaint plantation in Georgia, accompanied by his best friends—an exotic tame moth collection.  But just when Punyala thought he was out, he was pulled back in.  They stole his pipette tips and resold them on the black market.  They stored his plates upside down.  Worst of all, they destroyed his vintage -20 freezer.  This time, it’s no longer just another job.  It’s personal.
                        <br>
                        <br>This autumn, Amith Punyala is out for vengeance, raising his Eppendorf one final time.  Watch in your local IMAX® theatre or convention center starting October 24.

                        This is Amy, basically the most loved member on iGEM. She always comes in clutch when making the most beautiful and aesthetic pages of the website. Not only is she basically a goddess in CS, she is also extremely multitalented, enjoying tennis, hiking, and even cooking (especially in the video game Overcooked)! Even though she is basically in love with Jon Snow (and snow in general), she is definitely not cold in any way. She is actually extremely humble and kind, and always willing to help with anything (since she’s basically a genius at everything). She is just as adorable as the Baymax plushie that she treasures, and deserves all the happiness in the world :).

                        Ashwin - a man with luscious hair often tied up in a captivating man bun, a man who towers over anyone he meets (I guess it’s fitting that both of his labs are on Tower Road). Now you would probably think that a tall, charming man like him would never be able to get along with a tiny girl like me (I don’t even reach his shoulders). Well, you’re right - we don’t. Whether it is giving each other unimpressed looks or him blasting compressed air at me after every few words that I speak, we just cannot seem to stop bickering with each other. But all in all, he’s a hardworking man that you can definitely count on.

A veritable powerhouse, Max can often be seen roaming the hallways of Weill Hall or the atria of Duffield pondering where exactly his life went wrong. However, Max is so unafraid of failure that he chose to major in two difficult STEM majors (Biological Engineering and Computer Science) so he could fail twice as much. The original formulator of our current project, Max's knowledge of seemingly inane facts amazes us all. A founding member of the iGEM Chicken Club, his clout (and determination to eat chicken wings) knows no bounds. As an aspiring...something, Max is a true Renaissance man, splitting his time between such diverse fields as cooking, research, crying, and occasionally, homework.

When I’m not coding, I’m probably spending too much time at Mehak. I love alpacas so much that I stuck a poster of one in my room and got a bunch of alpaca stickers for my laptop. Other than staring at alpacas, I like to blast music through my headphones and sometimes I worry I am losing my hearing. I wonder why.

Faon has a ton of great character traits and is a born scientist/future physician. Let's talk about what Fuon would also be great at. Foin would be a phenomenal basketball player. Foen would be amazing at live television. Foan would be great at being an archaeologist. Foun would be probably the greatest White House Chief of Staff ever in office. More importantly however, noiF is an invaluable member of our team and it wouldn't be the same without her. We're truly lucky to have Fyon.

                        Meet Carol, otherwise known as the CU Ghost! Legend says Carol originated from the distant lands of the Bay area in California. As a member of Cornell iGEM, she quickly rose up the ranks until she peaked, obtaining the coveted title of Sub-Team Lead. Unfortunately, in her junior year at Cornell, Carol contracted Med School Apps. Since then no one has heard from her, as she vanished off the face of the Earth. Every once in a while though, if he/she is lucky, a stray member may hear whispers in the basement of Weill Hall from this passed PCR Goddess or spot a brief glimpse of her at a casual G-body meeting.

                        Ann Metzloff, ladies and gentlemen! Many of you may know her as the namesake and co-creator of the (future) Nobel Prize-winning q5annMich PCR protocol, but she is much more than that. A chemical engineer by day, Ann moonlights as a lab queen by mid-afternoon, and she likes to spend her free time commuting to and from her dorm in Schuyler House. Zonk is one of the many words that she likes. If you need someone to get the job done, she's your girl! Night may have fallen before she's made it to you from Schuyler, but let me tell you, it's worth the wait. Gosh, if you want to know the one word that describes Ann best, read the first letter of every sentence.

                        Charles is like an onion. Not only does he make us cry, he's a multilayered person with potentially more than one positive quality. A hardworking, kind, and devout Christian boy, Charles seems to embody everything we'd want in our future child's spouse. However, peel back this layer, and you're confronted by a mass of degeneracy, tenuously held together by memes and K-Pop. We've only gotten to this layer, but I'm sure it doesn't get much better from here. Degeneracy aside, Charles is an integral member of the Cornell iGEM team, effortlessly juggling lab responsibilities with his double (triple?!) major and spontaneous bubble tea appointments. Expect things from Charles, some of which may be good, in the future.

She skillfully balances her schoolwork and lab work and is always willing to lend a helping hand. Her enthusiasm is clearly appreciated by others, and people are excited to see her wherever she goes! Michelle also has a keen sense for locating free food, which is much appreciated by her other teammates. When not working in the lab, Michelle amazes us all with her outdoorsiness and sense of adventure! She’s a member of Outdoor Odyssey and frequently enjoys trips camping and rock climbing. We are lucky to have Michelle’s dedication and talent!!

This previously endangered animal became internet famous and is known as “the happiest animal in the world.” Well look no further because we have our own quokka here on the team! Hailing from San Diego, this mans resembles the appearance of the cute smol animal like no other. If you ever need to find him, 99.99% chance he is in Uris library, sipping cocktails in the cocktail lounge. Be careful not to give him too much because he might just fall asleep on you. However, you must know that his drink of choice is tea. Although he doesn't have it often, when he does, he brews really big pots of tea.

Why did he just randomly start doing push ups? How did he just make a perfect steak at midnight sporting nothing but briefs, with only a pair of chopsticks and some salt? Undoubtably questionable, Jackie has made great contributions to the team, most noticably through his ability to physically intimidate cells to do what we want by simply flexing over a petri dish. Though he has great technical ability, Jackie still puts the sexy in burning bread because somehow microwaving it was going to fix it. Wait.

                        This is the story of a woman named Jennifer. Jennifer worked for a company in a big building where she was Employee #7513. Employee #7513’s job was simple: she sat at her desk in room 7513 and she pushed buttons on a keyboard. Orders came to her through a monitor on her desk, telling her what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order. This is what Employee #7513 did every day of every month of every year, and although others might have considered it soul rending, Jennifer relished every moment the orders came in, as though she had been made exactly for this job. And Jennifer was happy. Jennifer is a CS major.

                        If you didn’t think a room could get any brighter, just wait until Rachel steps foot in it. One of the cutest rays of sunshine you’ll ever find on Cornell’s campus, Rachel is as fun and cheerful as the sprinkles she loves to eat. Rachel is fearless because she WILL. DRINK. THAT. BOBA. (and immediately take a Lactaid because ain’t nobody got time for lactose intolerance). You’ll never catch her setting foot in Carpenter Hall unless the world is coming to an end (and even then it’s still debatable). When she’s not busy being a star BME student, Rachel can be found actively petting dogs and speed-walking to her classes.

                        Warning: This bio may be too wholesome for some. But that's because Aaron is the most wholesome human being you'll ever meet. When's he's not engineering biologically, doing experiments in the dungeons of Weill, and chucking gnarly tosses on the ultimate frisbee team, you can find him hanging with his friends. And boi those friends are lucky because he's always willing to listen to what's going on in other people's lives and he'll help them out in the best way he knows how... Netflix and Chill (and giving awesome advice). Everyone on the team has a story of Netflix and Chilling with Aaron. He'll watch just about anything with anyone at anytime. He'll people into shows like Samuria Jack, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Rick and Morty. He's also loves art, reading, smiling, laughing, hugs, and super sick handshakes. If you see Aaron walking assume he already knows what handshake you should do together. Give him some love, he'll give it right back :)

                        If you ever need help with any academic subject, there is no need to go to office hours, if you just ask Harry. Yet I rarely see him actually study. Do not be fooled by your first impression, because Harry has a sassy side to his silent and strong exterior, which comes out in the most unexpected situations. Having grown up in Bay Area, he drinks milk tea for lunch and drinks even more for dinner. In his free time, you can see him rock-climbing or winning at card games against his friends! If you take the time to get to know him, you will realize that he is a friend you can trust and depend on.  If you are interested in becoming friends with Harry, email him at 2smart4you@cornell.edu

                        Karen Zhan is currently a sophomore on PD and P&amp;P double majoring in Environment &amp; Sustainability and Info Sci. Her favorite color is blue, and she can usually be found napping somewhere sunny. Now that all the boring obligatory stuff is out of the way, Karen is the most laid back, chill person you’ll meet because she is basically a protagonist out of a YA novel. In her free time, she hangs with pet ducks and chickens, plays guitar and piano, dances, and tries art even though she claims she’s “not that good” at it. BS, Karen. Say hi to her if you run into her, she’s friendly and will probably say hi back.
