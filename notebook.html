             testing for harmful algal blooms and the effects of microcystins.
              We also reached out to organizations that are related to 
              genetically engineering bacteria or therapeutics. We conducted an 
              interview with Professor John March who is doing research on 
              genetically engineered therapeutics, and he suggested that we 
              should go through the IND application process and look into Synlogics.

            P&P continued to read research papers to find the biological significance of microcystins to make sure that it was okay to remove them from the ecosystem. We also emailed some more researchers on their current research on HABs and microcystins roles specifically. P&P interviewed Professor Nelson Hairston, a microbiology professor, on the subject of HABs and how to detect them or predict their patterns of emergence. We also looked into the ecological ramifications of removing cyanobacteria and microcystins from the water and found a lack of conclusive results in general. There were many good takeaways from this interview, and overall, it really helped in the brainstorming and design process. P&P also reached out to organizations that related to microfluidics and healthcare, such as Weill Cornell Medicine and Saint Joseph’s Health Center. We interviewed Professor Jan Lammerding on 3/11 regarding the feasibility of our microfluidics idea and potential applications of our project. We also initiated a collaborative invitation with the BME Society for Dr. Caltagirone, the president and CEO of Aptagen, to give a Synthetic Antibodies Talk at Cornell in April.

We have been mentoring Kim with her project to isolate AB15 from sorghum and helping Darlsy organize the schedule of her project as part of our outreach initiative with Zimbabwean students interested in synthetic biology. We have been answering any questions she may have about isolating the gene or what resources are good to use. We also made pre- and post-booklet distribution surveys. P&P traveled to the Ithaca Farmers Market to get the contact information of vendors and were able to start some meaningful conversations about HABs. We intend to schedule brief meetings with these community members to get a further understanding of their knowledge of HABs and how HABs may have impacted them. The team conducted Skype meetings with the NYU iGEM (6/19) and Ohio State iGEM (6/21) teams. Both teams are relatively new to iGEM and sought advice on how to organize the team and proceed with their projects. We suggested a potential PD collaboration with NYU to work on the bioreactor since their team intends to create a bioreactor in the context of flavonoids. With the Ohio State iGEM team, we pitched the idea of a potential P&P collaboration once we have finished the materials for our HABs informational booklet. We also began doing research for our HABs informational booklet. We prepared materials for the 4-H Careers Exploration Event by creating a Kahoot! and revising our slides from Splash! P&P also reached out to Toronto iGEM to ask about a potential collaboration. Member Spotlight was planned out as well.

Specifically, we focused on the Clean Water Act and the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Acts and their legislative history. We worked some more on fixing the pre- and post-booklet distribution surveys. We continued to work on material and revisions for the HABs informational booklet. We also looked into past iGEM projects in order to see which parts might be applicable to our current project. P&P sent emails to the community members that we spoke to last week at the Ithaca Farmers Market. We lead 6 sessions of our 4-H Careers Exploration event, where students from various middle schools in the local region visited Cornell to learn about synthetic biology. One chaperone came up to us after one of the Thursday morning sessions and told us that her daughter was in one of the Wednesday sessions and said that our class was the one she enjoyed the most! We revised, formatted, and sent our pre-distribution booklet survey to Ohio State iGEM as part of our collaboration. We continued to do Member Spotlights.

We also conversed with adults to share what our team does and the projects we’ve worked on. Our team also met with Deborah Dawson, the Chair of the Planning, Energy, and Environmental Quality Committee, to discuss how our project might fit into the grand scheme of efforts to combat the issue of HABs in our region.
