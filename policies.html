                        Everybody advocates for clean drinking water and pristine lakes, but not everybody would 
                        be comfortable using synthetic biology to achieve these goals. Our team examined the current 
                        legislation in place to control and define safe levels of microcystins, especially in New York, 
                        to set parameters for our bio-reactor and boat. To expand upon our knowledge, we interviewed 
                        local legislators to hear firsthand the new laws and policies being created in response to 
                        increased HAB appearances in recent years due to climate change. Additionally, we interviewed 
                        experts in marine biology and freshwater systems, as well as volunteers on the frontlines 
                        combating the effects of HABs in the Finger Lake region, to ensure we have a comprehensive 
                        understanding of the situation so we can harness the full potential of our proposed system.

                            Legislation on HABs have been in place for years, but recently, the interest in HABs has 
                            increased substantially. Legislative proposals are being considered to address the increase 
                            in HAB occurrences, especially around the Cayuga Lake region.

                            Although current methods of prevention and treatment are sufficiently effective, they are 
                            also costly and time-consuming. New systems to detect and breakdown microcystins would improve 
                            both safety and cost-effectiveness.

                            HABs are dangerous to humans and are of increasing concern, mainly due to climate change that 
                            has likely contributed to more frequent appearances.

                        To take reHAB to widespread use, our project needs to abide by current legislation for HAB remediation. 
                        We first looked into the legislature on the federal level regarding water quality. The Clean Water Act 
                        of 1972 set standards for chemical discharges from companies, but it wasn’t until 1998 that Congress 
                        recognized the severity of harmful algal blooms and passed the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research 
                        and Control Act (HABHRCA).
                    </p>
                    <p class="standard-page-content-text">
                        The HABHRCA, passed in 2004 and most recently re-authorized in 2017, provides funding for the National 
                        Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to continue research on the ability to detect, monitor 
                        and assess HABs. For this purpose, 13.5 million dollars was allocated to the NOAA, with this amount 
                        increasing in small increments until 2023. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="standard-page-content-text">
                        While these legislative acts helped us key into the current state of HAB remediation research, we found 
                        that the primary effort for HAB remediation takes place at the state and local level. For the State of 
                        New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo introduced a four-point initiative to combat HABs in Upstate New York. 
                        While the initiative provides $65 million to identify, prioritize and develop action plans for vulnerable 
                        lakes, the efforts are largely focused on the prevention and identification of blooms, whereas our project 
                        is more concerned with the detection and remediation of blooms already in existence.
                    </p>
                    <p class="standard-page-content-text">
                        Focusing on local policies here in Ithaca, our team decided to attend a public meeting of the Planning, 
                        Energy, and Environmental Quality Committee from the Tompkins County Legislature. The meeting covered a 
                        broad range of topics related to the environmental concerns of Tompkins County rather than focusing on HABs, 
                        so we decided to contact Deborah Dawson, who is the Chair of the Committee. Our goal with reaching out to 
                        Mrs. Dawson was to get a firsthand account of what sorts of limiting factors affect the initiatives that are 
                        currently being undertaken to address the issue of HABs in the Finger Lakes region. Mrs. Dawson explained to 
                        us how the process involved in implementing new approaches differed between the lakes based on how the area 
                        was divided up among the neighboring counties. She mentioned that it is easier to address HABs concerns in 
                        smaller lakes due to the fact that only a single county has to devote its resources to remediation and can 
                        prioritize their level of concern. With larger lakes, such as Cayuga Lake, which is divided between three 
                        counties, there must be an active collaboration initiative. This can be difficult to coordinate, as each county 
                        may have different priorities and concerns for lake health. Mrs. Dawson’s insights pushed us to consider how to 
                        best integrate our designs into the established network of programs and individuals involved in tackling the 
                        issue of HABs.
                    </p>
                    <p class="standard-page-content-text">
                        Overall, we learned that the majority of legislation for HABs exists at the national and state level. However, 
                        most of this legislation is broad and geared towards research. On local levels, where there is a more central 
                        focus on the issue, there is still a lack of comprehensive legislation, as many initiatives are still being discussed. 
                        By working with legislators and community leaders, our team hopes to use our project to push these initiatives 
                        forward to provide clean and safe waters for our community and the world.

                        Comprehensive Environmental Assessment (CEA) is a type of risk assessment that incorporates the two traditional 
                        assessment approaches: risk and life cycle assessment. The advantage of life cycle assessment (LCA) is in its wide 
                        scope; it considers all steps of manufacturing, usage, and disposal or recycling of the chemical or product. 
                        Risk assessment (RA) is advantageous in that it specifically quantifies the risk, providing a resolution through the 
                        analysis. CEA aims to combine the strengths of both assessment techniques by providing a guideline for organizing 
                        information from various stakes and making transparent judgements based on the input.<sup>1</sup>

                        This framework is currently used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. As our project intends to provide a 
                        robust solution for harmful algal blooms and therefore necessitates direct interaction with  the environment, we must 
                        assess the long-term impacts of our project on the environment. The comprehensive environmental assessment of our 
                        project focuses on the genetically altered bacteria <i>Escherichia coli</i> and the potential impacts the altered 
                        bacteria may have on the environment.

                        Our project aims to develop <i>E. coli</i> that can degrade microcystins, a primary toxin that is produced by harmful 
                        algal blooms. Our project involves two steps: detection of microcystins in water and remediation of said contaminated water. 
                        The first step, detection, involves using naked RNA to sense microcystins. Our team is aiming to create an aptamer-based 
                        sensor to recognize microcystins. The second step involves engineering the mlr cassette into <i>E. coli</i> to breakdown the 
                        toxins. The mlr cassette is a series of six genes that gives <i>E. coli</i> the ability to degrade microcystins, including mlrA, 
                        mlrB, mlrC, mlrD, mlrE, and mlrF that each take on different roles in breaking down the toxins. For instance, mlrD produces t
                        he genes responsible for transporting the microcystins into the cell. To carry out the degradation more efficiently, some mlr 
                        genes are designed to be transported to the cell’s periplasm.

                        In the event that our detection and remediation system gets integrated into drinking water treatment facilities, or is used 
                        for instantaneous lake testing and feedback, competition and biodiversity would be the main concern regarding the modification 
                        of <i>E. coli</i>. However, our current system isolates the bacteria from the freshwater ecosystems to avoid the risk of 
                        horizontal gene transfer. Regardless, our team has taken steps to ensure the containment of the modified bacteria by immobilizing 
                        them on alginate beads. Moreover, we are strategically placing filters in the inlet and outlet of the reaction chamber to ensure 
                        that microcystins can enter the system but bacteria would not be able to get out.

                        Since our altered genes produce proteins that give metabolic strain on themselves, there exists a low possibility that the 
                        engineered strains would outcompete wild strains when used in a setting outside of the lab. There does exist a possibility 
                        that the antibiotic resistant genes may be transferred to other bacterial strains. However, auxotrophy can serve as a potential 
                        solution to eliminate such genes. Auxotrophy is the inability of a gene to synthesize organic compounds needed for growth. By 
                        implementing auxotrophy onto the altered <i>E. coli</i>, we can decrease the possibility of the altered genes being transferred to other 
                        bacterial strains.

                        Solutions, such as biocontainment techniques that isolate the bacteria from the environment, can be used to prevent horizontal gene 
                        transfer (HGT) of antibiotic resistant genes from the mutated genes to the environment. We are approaching the problem of HGT from a 
                        mechanical angle to implement physical barriers between the bacteria and the environment in order to prevent contamination and gene transfer.

                        Currently, there are a few steps that take place when trying to collect water samples and identify the presence of microcystins. Most 
                        samples are collected by volunteers from local organizations, meaning collections tend to be free or inexpensive. After samples are collected,
                         there are multiple ways to test for the presence of microcystins. The most common way is through an ELISA, which ranges from $125 to $200 
                         dollars per sample. The most common price for a test, however, is $125 per sample. There usually is more than one sample so sending 
                         multiple samples will be costly. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="standard-page-content-text">
                        Another variable in this analysis is the uncertainty of receiving results. From our conversation with Julie Lockheart from Owasco Lake 
                        Association, results from the samples take up to three weeks to process and analyze. By this time, microcystins clear up and the results 
                        would not be effective in preventing damage from the toxins. Our boat serves as a replacement for volunteers and collects samples based on 
                        areas in the lake where HABs are most common. Although the boat costs around $200, it saves time by acting as an automated sample collector 
                        with high-resolution data capabilities. It can work throughout the day, mapping locations of blooms around the lake. The DNA aptamers with 
                        the gold nanoparticles serve to replace ELISA kits and remove the issue of waiting for results. The gold nanoparticles cost approximately 
                        $150 for 25 mL and the aptamer cost around $10. Our system is functional for 130 uses. This is significantly more economical than the $125 
                        per sample charged by laboratories to test using an ELISA.

                        At the moment, the price of clearing microcystins ranges widely. In a report done by the American Water Works association, depending on how 
                        long the treatment is, it could vary from $178 for 3 days of prevention and treatment to $280,000 for 3 months of prevention and treatment 
                        of cyanotoxins. This is compared to our project, which only requires $500 to build a small scale bioreactor that can last a significantly longer time.

                        Damage caused by microcystins varies greatly depending on the water treatment facility and the amount of time the plant was exposed to the microcystins. 
                        One of the worst cases of cyanotoxins affecting drinking water was in Toledo, Ohio. The water plant in the city had to spend $54 million dollars on a 
                        new treatment facility to remove contaminants like microcystins. This is, however, an extreme case, where Toledo was exposed to large amounts of microcystins 
                        for a long period of time. Regardless, this demonstrates the damage microcystins can do to water treatment facilities. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="standard-page-content-text">
                        The damage caused by microcystins can be negated by the early detection offered by the aptamer system. Treatment would also be low-cost and effective. 
                        The bioreactor costs less than $100 taking into consideration the alginate beads, the materials to make the actual reactor, and the engineered bacteria. 
                        The alginate beads also last several years without degrading, so replacing the alginate beads would not be costly.
